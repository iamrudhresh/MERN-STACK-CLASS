# React Assignment - Day 05

1. **Difference between Named Export, Default export, and * as export:**
   - Named Export: Exports multiple named values from a module.
   - Default Export: Exports a single default value from a module.
   - `* as export`: Imports all exports from a module as a single object.

2. **Importance of config.js file:**
   - Stores configuration settings used across the application.
   - Centralizes configuration, making it easier to manage and update.

3. **What are React Hooks?**
   - Functions enabling functional components to use state and other React features.
   - Allow functional components to manage state and lifecycle methods without classes.

4. **Why do we need a useState Hook?**
   - Adds state to functional components, making them more flexible.
   - Allows functional components to manage and update their own state.
