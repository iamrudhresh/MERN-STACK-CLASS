# DAY 02 - REACT ASSIGNMENT

## Theory Assignment:

1. **What is NPM?**
   - NPM is a tool for getting and managing packages of code for JavaScript.

2. **What is Parcel/vite? Why do we need it?**
   - Parcel and Vite are build tools that bundle and optimize web assets like JavaScript and CSS. We need them to make development easier and faster.

3. **What is .parcel-cache?**
   - .parcel-cache is a folder used by Parcel to store compiled assets and speed up builds.

4. **What is npx?**
   - npx is a tool to run packages without installing them globally.

5. **What is the difference between dependencies vs devDependencies?**
   - Dependencies are needed for the app to run, while devDependencies are only needed for development.

6. **What is Tree Shaking?**
   - Tree shaking removes unused code from the final bundle to make it smaller.

7. **What is Hot Module Replacement?**
   - Hot Module Replacement allows modules to be replaced without refreshing the browser during development.

8. **What is .gitignore? What should we add and not add into it?**
   - .gitignore tells Git which files to ignore. We should add files like node_modules and build artifacts, but not code or configuration files.

9. **What is the difference between package.json and package-lock.json?**
   - package.json lists project dependencies, while package-lock.json locks down specific versions of dependencies.

10. **Why should I not modify package-lock.json?**
    - Modifying package-lock.json can cause dependency conflicts and inconsistencies.

11. **What is node_modules? Is it a good idea to push that on git?**
    - node_modules is where dependencies are stored. It's not a good idea to push it to Git because it can bloat the repository size.

12. **What is the dist folder?**
    - The dist folder contains optimized and bundled assets ready for deployment.

13. **What is browserlists?**
    - Browserlist is a configuration file that specifies which browsers or environments a project supports.

14. **What do caret (^) and tilde (~) mean in package.json?**
    - ^ allows updates to minor and patch versions, while ~ allows only patch updates within a specific version.

15. **What are script types in HTML?**
    - Script types specify the type of script being referenced in HTML, like JavaScript or modules.
