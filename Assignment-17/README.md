# DAY 01 - REACT ASSIGNMENT

## Theory

1. **What is Emmet?**
   - Emmet is a shorthand syntax for writing HTML and CSS code quickly. It allows developers to use abbreviations and shortcuts to generate code snippets.

2. **Difference between a Library and Framework?**
   - A library is a collection of functions and reusable code that can be called upon to perform specific tasks. Developers have more control over the flow of their code when using a library. On the other hand, a framework provides a structure for building applications and dictates the flow of control. Developers need to adhere to the framework's conventions and patterns.

3. **What is CDN? Why do we use it?**
   - CDN stands for Content Delivery Network. It is a network of distributed servers that deliver web content to users based on their geographic location. CDNs improve website performance by caching content and reducing latency, resulting in faster loading times for users.

4. **Why is React known as React?**
   - React is called React because it reacts to changes in data. It efficiently updates and renders components when there are changes in the application's state, providing a smooth and responsive user experience.

5. **What is crossorigin in the script tag?**
   - The crossorigin attribute in the script tag is used when loading scripts from a different origin (domain) than the current webpage. It allows the browser to make cross-origin requests for the script while adhering to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policies.

6. **What is the difference between React and ReactDOM?**
   - React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, while ReactDOM is a package that provides DOM-specific methods for React. ReactDOM is responsible for rendering React components into the DOM.

7. **What is the difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?**
   - react.development.js is the development version of the React library, which includes helpful warnings and error messages to aid in development and debugging. react.production.js, on the other hand, is the production version optimized for performance and does not include any development-specific features or warnings.

8. **What is async and defer?**
   - Both async and defer are attributes used with the script tag to control when and how scripts are loaded and executed.
     - **async**: The async attribute tells the browser to download the script asynchronously without delaying the HTML parsing. Once the script is downloaded, it is executed immediately, even if the HTML parsing is not yet complete.
     - **defer**: The defer attribute tells the browser to download the script asynchronously while parsing the HTML. However, the script execution is deferred until the HTML parsing is complete, ensuring that the script is executed in the order it appears in the document.
