# Day 03 - REACT ASSIGNMENT

## Topics Covered

- **JSX**: JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript, making it easier to build and compose React components.
- **React.createElement vs JSX**: React.createElement is a method used to create React elements programmatically, while JSX provides a more readable and concise syntax for creating React elements.
- **Benefits of JSX**: JSX provides several benefits, including improved readability, simplified syntax, and enhanced developer experience.
- **Behind the Scenes of JSX**: JSX is transformed into React.createElement calls by tools like Babel during the build process, enabling developers to write code using familiar HTML-like syntax.
- **Babel & Parcel Role in JSX**: Babel is a JavaScript compiler that transforms JSX into JavaScript code that browsers can understand, while Parcel is a bundler that processes JSX along with other assets to create optimized bundles for deployment.
- **Components**: Components are the building blocks of React applications, encapsulating reusable UI elements and logic.
- **Functional Components**: Functional components are a type of React component defined as JavaScript functions, often used for presentational purposes.
- **Composing Components**: Composing components involves combining multiple smaller components to create larger, more complex UIs.

## Assignment

1. **What is JSX?**
   - JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript, making it easier to build and compose React components.

2. **Superpowers of JSX**
   - JSX provides several benefits, including:
     - Improved readability: JSX resembles HTML, making it easier for developers to understand and write code.
     - Simplified syntax: JSX simplifies the process of creating and manipulating React elements.
     - Enhanced developer experience: JSX facilitates the use of tools like Babel and Parcel to transform and bundle code efficiently.

3. **Role of type attribute in the script tag? What options can I use there?**
   - The type attribute in the script tag specifies the media type of the script. Options include:
     - **text/javascript**: Default type for JavaScript code.
     - **module**: Indicates that the script is a JavaScript module.

4. **{TitleComponent} vs {} vs {} in JSX**
   - `{TitleComponent}`: Renders the content of the `TitleComponent` as a child component.
   - `{}`: Allows embedding JavaScript expressions or variables within JSX.
   - `{}`: Used for passing props to components in JSX.
